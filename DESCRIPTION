Description: This package compiles some functions for quick, dirty, and
  repetitive exploratory analysis which may otherwise lengthen the script
  unnecessarily. Emphasis is placed on the purpose of credit scoring, where
  WoE modelling (Semi Naive Bayesian Classification) is routinely used. Most of
  functions caters to the prediction of binary target variable.
